# Local Machine Configuration

**This file is gitignored** - Contains machine-specific paths and settings that should not be committed.

## Setup

1. Copy this file to `local.config.md`
2. Update paths below with your actual game installation location
3. Use `local.config.md` for reference during development

## Game Directory

**Schedule I Installation Path** (Windows):
```
E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Schedule I
```

**WSL Path** (for scripts):
```
/mnt/e/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Schedule I
```

Common locations to check:
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Schedule I`
- `/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Schedule I` (WSL)
- Custom Steam library: `<drive>:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Schedule I`
- Find it: `find /mnt -name "Schedule I" -type d 2>/dev/null`

## Setup Commands

```bash
# Setup game references (replace path with your local.config.md path)
./scripts/setup-refs.sh "/mnt/e/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Schedule I"

# Build project
./scripts/build.sh

# Deploy to game (replace path with your local.config.md path)
./scripts/deploy.sh "/mnt/e/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Schedule I" il2cpp
```
